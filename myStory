There once was a man. He was very large and strong, but he was quiet and didn't move much. His legs were like tree trunks. His arms were... also like tree trunks. His forearms were like tree trunks. His calves? Tree trunks. His neck was also like a tree trunk. People called him "Tree trunk", and whenever they saw him, they said "Look at that man! His parts look like tree trunks!" Some of the more adventurous thinkers of his time thought that he was actually just a bunch of tree trunks tied together, but the people burned them at the stake. They saw a sort of cruel irony, being tied to a tree trunk before their immolation.
