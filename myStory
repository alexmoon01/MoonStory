There once was a man. He was very large and strong, but he was quiet and didn't move much. His legs were like tree trunks. His arms were... also like tree trunks. His forearms were like tree trunks. His calves? Tree trunks. His neck was also like a tree trunk. People called him "Tree trunk", and whenever they saw him, they said "Look at that man! His parts look like tree trunks!" Some of the more adventurous thinkers of his time thought that he was actually just a bunch of tree trunks tied together, but the people burned them at the stake. They saw a sort of cruel irony, being tied to a tree trunk before their immolati.

In another weird twist of fate, the tree trunk man could only find work as a lumberjack. Day after day he would leave the rustic cabin where he lived to go chop down trees until nightfall. Wherever he went, he saw tree trunks like himself, and he grew to thinking he was just another cog in the machine. His spirit only remained uncrushed by the hopes that one day he would travel to a big city and find work in a crowded office building free from all the crushing monotony of nature.

Years passed, and the tree trunk man's spirits withered away until nothing remained. Fed up with his miserable life, he threw down his ax and marched forward, not stopping until he reached the big city of his dreams. Upon arriving, the tree trunk man sought out the tallest office building in view. He barged through the front door and demanded a job without a second thought. Thus began his journey as a paper salesman.

More years passed and the tree trunk man lived a fulfilled life as a paper salesman. Until one day, the media announced that all industry will convert to electronic. Complaining to his paper salesman friends "Electronic, why??",
"Something about the environment" one saleesman said. Suddenly, the tree trunk man found himself out of a job again.
